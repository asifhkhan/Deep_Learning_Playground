# What is Deep Learning? :thinking:
Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks.

##  Neural Networks Playground :brain:

This is a tool to experiment basic neural network architectures and build intuitions on machine learning.

The main idea is provide an environnement to experiment how data and learning parameters affects the network training.
